      question: "What is a stock market index?",
      answer: "A stock market index is a measurement of the value of a section of the stock market. It is computed from the prices of selected stocks and is used as a benchmark to track the performance of a particular market segment."
    },
    {
      question: "How are index values calculated?",
      answer: "Most Indian indices use the free-float market capitalization method. This means the index value is calculated based on the market value of shares that are available for trading, excluding shares held by promoters, government, and other strategic investors."
    },
    {
      question: "What does it mean when an index goes up or down?",
      answer: "When an index goes up, it means the overall value of the stocks in that index has increased. This generally indicates positive market sentiment and economic growth. When it goes down, it suggests the opposite."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I invest directly in an index?",
      answer: "You cannot invest directly in an index, but you can invest in index funds or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that track the performance of the index. These funds hold the same stocks in the same proportions as the index."
    },
    {
      question: "How often are indices updated?",
      answer: "Stock market indices are calculated and updated in real-time during market hours. The values change continuously as the prices of constituent stocks fluctuate throughout the trading day."
    }
